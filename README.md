# lyricShuffle3000

This lyricShuffler is supposed to read from a pdf or textfile full  of lyrics. it then should store their content and after that reconstruct them to new lyrics, according to given parameters  like language, sentecelength and so on. ideally, the shuffleer later on should implement a text-to-Speech-generator, which would read the newly created texts out loud.
