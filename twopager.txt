1988- STILL IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH

There's a chain, that holds him back again.
It's the ring around his finger,
Like he's captived in magnetic fields,
He's secluded from real life.
There's a thing, that makes her cry again,
but to tell him she still lingers.
Like she'd know, what he is thinking of,
his look cuts her like a knife.

Bridge:
Love's gone, long ago.
Love's gone with time.
It's flown away, like time did.

Refrain:
Feelings faded far away.
Feelings faded as time slipped away.
And now there's only crying.

There's something making her depressions even worse.
It's the look in lovers' eyes.
That special look,
she once had in her eyes too,
when it all began.
One fine day, they may just feel
the same as she does now.
But yet, none of them's lying.
And he thinks 'While they're just about to start,
We're already at the end.'

WONDERING

Wind's thrown into my face, as I do leave the place,
which my eyes just recognized.
I'm wondering, still wondering 'bout life.
Never stop, times to come, river flow on and on,
paths don't you ever end.
Going ever on I'm wondering 'bout life,

Refrain:
Cause of anything, we do, things, we're still up to do,
There's still so much to look at left, there are colours right ahead.
As minutes drop right on, like water's coming down,
as clouds around us move, there's still so much to look at left,
still colours right ahead.
Life's got so many ways, imagine just nights and days
Don't your dreams seem that real to you sometimes?
And then you're wondering about life?
